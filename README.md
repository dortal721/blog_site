### Key Features ###

The backend logic focuses on managing several crucial databases:

1. **Authors:** Stores detailed information about the authors contributing to the blog.
2. **Tags:** Manages content tags associated with each post for effective categorization.
3. **Posts:** Houses the core data for the blog, providing a structured repository for all posts.
4. **Comments:** Facilitates the storage of insightful comments from the engaged community.

### User-Centric Functionality ###

The web application takes user experience seriously. Users can seamlessly save and unsave posts for future reading, with the app intelligently curating a personalized list of posts tailored to each user's preferences. This functionality is powered by session data, ensuring a unique and satisfying experience for every user.

### Community Engagement ###

Encouraging user interaction is a key aspect of the implementation. Users can actively participate by posting comments on articles, fostering a sense of community and dialogue. All comments are securely stored in the dedicated database for future reference.

### Ongoing Developments ###

The commitment to excellence is reflected in current efforts to enhance the blog site. Active work is underway to integrate file uploads and prepare for deployment to AWS, ensuring a seamless and scalable experience for users.

Thank you for exploring my blog site project. I am excited about the journey ahead and look forward to continually improving and expanding this web application. If you have any questions or suggestions, feel free to reach out. Happy reading!
